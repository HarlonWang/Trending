## ✨ Core Features

- 📈 **Comprehensive Trends**: Real-time trending project lists for today, this week, and this month.
- 🤖 **AI Summaries**: Integration with Gemini / DeepSeek models to automatically extract core features and logic for each repository.
- 📅 **Historical Records**: Support for querying past lists by date and batch (Morning/Evening reports).
- 📱 **Native Cross-platform**: Built with Compose Multiplatform, supporting both Android and iOS with a single codebase.
